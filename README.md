# student-drop-out

<b>"Student Drop Out"</b> is a Python based console application to calculate the probability of dropout of any student.

It's also the very first project I did with Python. Hence, there are definitely many approaches which will be considered novice.

The sole purpose of this project was to help finding out the possible dropouts of the CSE department so that necessary steps can be taken against it. To do so, I used the scikit-learn library which included many machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier, Random Forest Classifier etc.

<b>"CSVReader"</b> is a Java based console application intended to normalize the available .csv files, which means to clear out unnecessary false inputs and garbabe entries.
